   - Name: "Alice"
   - Age: 25
   - City: "New York"

### Exercise 2: Access Dictionary Elements
C.
2. Access the value of the `"City"` key and print it.

2. Change the value of the `"Age"` key to 26.
3. Print the modified dictionary.

### Exercise 4: Remove Elements
1. Remove the `"City"` key from the `person` dictionary.
2. Print the dictionary after removing the key.

### Exercise 5: Check if a Key Exists
1. Check if the key `"email"` exists in the `person` dictionary. Print a message based on the result.
2. Check if the key `"phone"` exists in the dictionary. Print a message based on the result.

### Exercise 6:  Loop Through a Dictionary
1. Iterate over the person dictionary and print each key-value pair.
2. Iterate over the keys of the dictionary and print each key.
3. Iterate over the values of the dictionary and print each value.

### Exercise 7: Nested Dictionary
1. Create a dictionary called `employees` where the keys are employee IDs (`101`, `102`, `103`) and the values are dictionaries containing employee details (like name and job title). Example structure:
   ```python
   employees = {
       101: {"name": "Bob", "job": "Engineer"},
       102: {"name": "Sue", "job": "Designer"},
       103: {"name": "Tom", "job": "Manager"}
   }
   ```
2. Print the details of employee with ID `102`.
3. Add a new employee with ID `104`, name `"Linda"`, and job `"HR"`.
4. Print the updated dictionary.

### Exercise 8: Dictionary Comprehension
1. Create a dictionary comprehension that generates a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 1 to 5 and the values are the squares of the keys.
2. Print the generated dictionary.

### Exercise 9: Merge Two Dictionaries
1. Create two dictionaries:
   ```python
   dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
   dict2 = {"c": 3, "d": 4}
   ```
2. Merge `dict2` into `dict1` and print the result.

### Exercise 10: Default Dictionary Values
1. Create a dictionary that maps letters to numbers: `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`.
2. Use the `get()` method to retrieve the value of key `"b"`.
3. Use the `get()` method to try to retrieve the value of a non-existing key `"d"`, but provide a default value of `0` if the key is not found.

### Exercise 11: Dictionary from Two Lists
1. Given two lists:
   ```python
   keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
   values = ["Eve", 29, "San Francisco"]
   ```
2. Create a dictionary by pairing corresponding elements from the `keys` and `values` lists.
3. Print the resulting dictionary.

### Exercise 12: Count Occurrences of Words
1. Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and returns a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each word in the sentence.
   ```python
   sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox"
   ```
2. Print the dictionary showing word counts.
